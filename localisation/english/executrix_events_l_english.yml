 imperial_story.17.t: "The role of Vader"
 imperial_story.17.d: "With our situation apparent Lord Vader has continued to command the crew. However some have expressed unease over this. Some would prefer he assumed frontline command allowing Tarkin to take the reins of government, while others are happy to see vader assume supreme power. Admiral Thrawn has privately purposed a third option inspired by earth systems of governance in which Vader assumes the role of Emperor to give stability while Tarkin assumes the burden of day-to-day running of the growing list of government duties, freeing vader to take command where needed.
